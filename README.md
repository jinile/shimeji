## What is a Shimeji

Shimeji's are interactable pets/mascots/buddies that interact with the user's mouse, desktop, windows, and more elements on the page.


## Why Am I Coding This

The popular Shimeji-ee project was originally coded in Java, but I wanted to attempt to recreate it on my own using Python. It is currently a work in progress, I've start mouse interactions, but I want to implement windows interactions soon enough.
